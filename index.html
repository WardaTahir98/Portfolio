                    <img src="Flew.jpg" alt="" width="20%"> <br> <br> Once upon a time there was a crow. It was hot summer and He felt very thirsty. He flew here and there in search of water. <br> <br>
                
                   <img src="found.jpg" alt="" width="20%"> <br> <br>
                                    At last he saw a pot in the garden. There was a little water at the bottom of the pot. <br> <br><img src="hh.jpg" alt="" width="20%"> <br> <br> He tried but could not reach the water. He got an idea to rise up the water level.
                     <br> <br> <img src="kkjkj.jpg" alt="" width="20%"> <br> <br> So, he picked up the small stones nearby and dropped them into the pot one by one. <br><br><img src="mk.jpg" alt="" width="20%"> <br> <br> Now the water level rose up. <br> <br> <img src="lk.jpg" alt=""width=20%> 
                     <br> <br> He drank the water and flew away happily.
